Probabilistic Programming Models Represented as Hypergraphs
============================================================

Overview
--------

.. note::
   This section outlines probabilistic programming models that can be natively 
   represented in Venuvia using hypergraph structures. Hyperedges can naturally 
   express plates, overlapping plates, and multi-way dependencies.

Bayesian Networks
-----------------

.. todo::
   Describe how Bayesian networks can be mapped onto hypergraphs, including conditional 
   dependencies represented as hyperedges.

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
------------------------------

.. todo::
   Describe representation of mixture components, latent variables, and overlapping plates.

Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
-------------------------------

.. todo::
   Describe representation of causal nodes, directed edges, and overlapping intervention 
   sets as hyperedges.

Hierarchical Models / Multilevel Models
---------------------------------------

.. todo::
   Describe how hierarchical priors and nested plates can be expressed as nested hyperedges.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. todo::
   Describe how temporal dependencies and sequences can be represented, including 
   overlapping time slices and state transitions.

Topic Models (LDA, HDP)
-----------------------

.. todo::
   Describe how document-topic-word relationships can be expressed as hyperedges, 
   including overlapping plates for hierarchical topic models.

Factor Analysis / Probabilistic PCA
-----------------------------------

.. todo::
   Describe modeling of latent factors and observed variables as hyperedges, capturing 
   correlations across multiple dimensions.

Probabilistic Programming as Hypergraphs
========================================

Overview
--------

.. note::
   This workflow demonstrates how Venuvia can represent and compute probabilistic 
   programming models natively as hypergraphs, including Structural Causal Models (SCMs) 
   and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with overlapping hyperedges.

Hypergraph Initialization
-------------------------

.. todo::
   Define the hypergraph \( \mathcal{H} = (V, E) \) to represent a probabilistic program.

Assign Probabilistic Node Properties
------------------------------------

.. todo::
   Specify node-level probability distributions for variables in the probabilistic model.

Assign Probabilistic Hyperedge Properties
-----------------------------------------

.. todo::
   Specify hyperedge-level probability distributions to represent dependencies or plates.

Probabilistic Inference on Hypergraph Programs
----------------------------------------------

.. todo::
   Describe how inference is performed on hypergraph-represented programs, including 
   Bayesian updates, conjugacy, or approximate methods if needed.

Modeling SCMs and Overlapping Plates
------------------------------------

.. todo::
   Illustrate how overlapping plates or multi-way dependencies are represented as hyperedges.

Output & Analysis
----------------

.. todo::
   Explain outputs, visualization of hypergraph programs, and potential downstream usage.

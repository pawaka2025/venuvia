Workflow 1: Conjugate Inference on Hypergraphs
==================================

Overview
--------
This workflow demonstrates the use of conjugate priors for probabilistic inference 
on hypergraph algorithms using Venuvia.

Objective Definition
-------------------------
We shall begin with an often-used hypergraph algorithm - K-core decomposition. A K-core, when applied to hypergraphs, may be defined in a number of different ways but for now let us go with a single definition: The sum of all weights of hyperedges that a node is a member of - overlapping hyperedges included. Thus a K-core decomposition involves filtering out every node in a hypergraph that does not meet the required number of K-cores - let it be K = n, or K > = n, or K < n, and so on.
Furthermore, in the context of conjugate inference, we will also add an additional criteria: a probabilistic chance P(K) ie to filter the hypergraph for nodes that are 80% likely to have a K-core of at least 5. This is pragmatically useful for 1 - eliminating the need to compute solutions with absolute certainty when high-confidence solutions would already suffice, 2 - allowing flexibility for an algorithm to be used alongside fuzzy or random variables.

For this demonstration we shall settle onto a singular objective for the rest of the workflow: a K-core decomposition where P(K >= 4) = 85%.

Hypergraph Algorithms
==========================================

Overview
--------

.. note::
   This section outlines several key hypergraph algorithms that can be implemented 
   and accelerated using Venuvia.

K-Core Decomposition
-------------------

.. note::
   Describe the k-core decomposition algorithm for hypergraphs and its probabilistic 
   variant in Venuvia.

Hypergraph Coloring
------------------

.. note::
   Describe algorithms for coloring hypergraphs, including conflict-free coloring 
   and applications in scheduling and resource allocation.

Maximal Clique Enumeration
-------------------------

.. note::
   Describe how to enumerate all maximal cliques or hypercliques in a hypergraph, 
   including probabilistic weighting of nodes.

Hyperedge Partitioning
---------------------

.. note::
   Describe algorithms for partitioning hyperedges to balance workloads, reduce 
   communication, or optimize parallel computation.

Hypergraph Matching
------------------

.. note::
   Describe maximum or weighted matching in hypergraphs, including applications 
   in network alignment or resource allocation.

Shortest Hyperpath / Hypergraph Distance
----------------------------------------

.. note::
   Describe algorithms for computing shortest paths in hypergraphs, or generalizing 
   distance measures for multi-node hyperedges.

Spectral Hypergraph Analysis
----------------------------

.. note::
   Describe spectral methods for hypergraphs, including Laplacian-based techniques 
   for clustering, dimensionality reduction, or community detection.

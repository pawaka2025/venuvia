Introduction

.. _Origin:

The name *Venuvia* is inspired by the planets Venus and Jovia (Jupiter), often visible together 
at dawn.

.. _Movitation:

Graphs have become increasingly popular as a modeling tool across domains, 
from social networks to recommendation systems. Yet, their expressiveness 
remains limited when applied to today's most critical use cases. 

Current graph technologies are heavily dependent on GPUs, creating several 
issues:

- **Cost and sustainability**: GPU-centric computation drives up energy usage, 
  contradicting the promise of technology to make systems cheaper and less 
  polluting.
- **Restricted data scope**: Existing approaches are biased toward 
  *static, non-temporal, and non-random* datasets, excluding many 
  real-world scenarios.
- **Uniformity assumptions**: Many GPU-based graph models enforce 
  homogeneous treatment of data, reducing flexibility in heterogeneous or 
  irregular contexts.
- **Vendor lock-in**: Solutions often force users into narrow ecosystems, 
  preventing broader applicability.

Venuvia addresses these challenges by rethinking how graphs can be extended 
to capture richer structures, without locking computation to GPUs or limiting 
the types of data that can be represented.
